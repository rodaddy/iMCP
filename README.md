## Getting Started

### Download and open the app

First, [download the iMCP app](https://iMCP.app/download)
(requires macOS 15.3 or later).

Or, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed,
you can run the following command:

```console
brew install --cask mattt/tap/iMCP
```

### Build from source

This fork is an Xcode project with two targets: the menu bar app and the
bundled `imcp-server` CLI. For local automation builds, use a development
signing identity and disable the app sandbox so Accessibility and UI scripting
tools can work:

```console
xcodebuild -project iMCP.xcodeproj -scheme iMCP -configuration Release build \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="TEAMID" \
  PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER="" ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX=NO
```

Install the built app into `/Applications`:

```console
BUILT_APP="$(xcodebuild -project iMCP.xcodeproj -scheme iMCP -configuration Release -showBuildSettings | awk -F ' = ' '/BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/ { dir=$2 } /FULL_PRODUCT_NAME/ { app=$2 } END { print dir "/" app }')"
ditto "$BUILT_APP" /Applications/iMCP.app
```

After replacing the app bundle, macOS may require you to re-grant
Accessibility, Screen Recording, and Automation permissions.

<img align="right" width="344" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-first-launch.png" alt="Screenshot of iMCP on first launch" />

When you open the app,
you'll see a
<img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" />
icon in your menu bar.

Clicking on this icon reveals the iMCP menu,
which displays all available services.
Initially, all services will appear in gray,
indicating they're inactive.

The blue toggle switch at the top indicates that the MCP server is running
and ready to connect with MCP-compatible clients.

<br clear="all">

<img align="right" width="372" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-grant-permission.png" alt="Screenshot of macOS permission dialog" />

### Activate services

To activate a service, click on its icon.
The system will prompt you with a permission dialog.
For example, when activating Calendar access, you'll see a dialog asking `"iMCP" Would Like Full Access to Your Calendar`.
Click <kbd>Allow Full Access</kbd> to continue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> iMCP **does not** collect or store any of your data.
> Clients like Claude Desktop _do_ send
> your data off device as part of tool calls.

<br clear="all">

<img align="right" width="344" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-all-services-active.png" alt="Screenshot of iMCP with all services enabled" />

Once activated,
each service icons goes from gray to their distinctive colors —
red for Calendar, green for Messages, blue for Location, and so on.

Repeat this process for all of the capabilities you'd like to enable.
These permissions follow Apple's standard security model,
giving you complete control over what information iMCP can access.

<br clear="all">

### Connect to Claude Desktop

If you don't have Claude Desktop installed,
you can [download it here](https://claude.ai/download).

Open Claude Desktop and go to "Settings... (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>)".
Click on "Developer" in the sidebar of the Settings pane,
and then click on "Edit Config".
This will create a configuration file at
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

<br/>

To connect iMCP to Claude Desktop,
click <img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" />
\> "Configure Claude Desktop".

This will add or update the MCP server configuration to use the
`imcp-server` executable bundled in the application.
Other MCP server configurations in the file will be preserved.

<details>
<summary>You can also configure Claude Desktop manually</summary>

Click <img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" />
\> "Copy server command to clipboard".
Then open `claude_desktop_config.json` in your editor
and enter the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iMCP": {
      "command": "{paste iMCP server command}"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<img align="right" width="372" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-approve-connection.png" />

### Call iMCP tools from Claude Desktop

Quit and reopen the Claude Desktop app.
You'll be prompted to approve the connection.

<br clear="all">

After approving the connection,
you should now see 🔨12 in the bottom right corner of your chat box.
Click on that to see a list of all the tools made available to Claude
by iMCP.

<p align="center">
  <img width="694" src="/Assets/claude-desktop-screenshot-tools-enabled.png" alt="Screenshot of Claude Desktop with tools enabled" />
</p>

Now you can ask Claude questions that require access to your personal data,
such as:

> "How's the weather where I am?"

Claude will use the appropriate tools to retrieve this information,
providing you with accurate, personalized responses
without requiring you to manually share this data during your conversation.

<p align="center">
  <img width="738" src="/Assets/claude-desktop-screenshot-message.png" alt="Screenshot of Claude response to user message 'How's the weather where I am?'" />
</p>

### Connect to [Claude Code][claude-code]

To add iMCP globally after installing the app:

```console
claude mcp add --scope user iMCP -- /Applications/iMCP.app/Contents/MacOS/imcp-server
```

<details>
<summary>Or import from Claude Desktop</summary>

If you've already configured Claude Desktop, you can import its MCP servers:

```console
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

</details>

### Connect to [Cursor][cursor]

Open this deep link to automatically install the iMCP server:

<a href="https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=iMCP&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiL0FwcGxpY2F0aW9ucy9pTUNQLmFwcC9Db250ZW50cy9NYWNPUy9pbWNwLXNlcnZlciAifQ%3D%3D">

    <img alt="Install MCP Server" src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg">
  </picture>
</a>

### Connect to [Amp][amp]

To add iMCP globally (available in all projects):

```console
amp mcp add iMCP -- /Applications/iMCP.app/Contents/MacOS/imcp-server
```

> [!NOTE]
> When a client first connects, iMCP will show an approval dialog.
> Click "Allow" and check "Always trust this client" to avoid repeated prompts.

### Keep iMCP running

iMCP needs the menu bar app to be running for `imcp-server` to service MCP
requests. If the app crashes or macOS terminates it, MCP clients will lose
access until the app is relaunched.

When running from a source checkout, this fork includes an optional per-user
LaunchAgent that starts iMCP at login and relaunches it after crashes or
non-zero exits:

```console
Scripts/launchd/install-keepalive.sh
```

By default, the installer targets `/Applications/iMCP.app`. To install a
different app bundle:

```console
Scripts/launchd/install-keepalive.sh /path/to/iMCP.app
```

To remove the LaunchAgent:

```console
Scripts/launchd/uninstall-keepalive.sh
```

The LaunchAgent is configured with `KeepAlive` only for unsuccessful exits, so
choosing Quit from iMCP should not immediately relaunch the app.

## Technical Details

### App & CLI

iMCP is a macOS app that bundles a command-line executable, `imcp-server`.

- [`iMCP.app`](/App/) provides UI for configuring services and — most importantly —
  a means of interacting with macOS system permissions,
  so that it can access Contacts, Calendar, and other information.
- [`imcp-server`](/CLI/) provides an MCP server that
  uses standard input/output for communication
  ([stdio transport][mcp-transports]).

The app and CLI communicate with each other on the local network
using [Bonjour][bonjour] for automatic discovery.
Both advertise a service with type "\_mcp.\_tcp" and domain "local".
Requests from MCP clients are read by the CLI from `stdin`
and relayed to the app;
responses from the app are received by the CLI and written to `stdout`.
See [`StdioProxy`](https://github.com/mattt/iMCP/blob/8cf9d250286288b06bf5d3dda78f5905ad0d7729/CLI/main.swift#L47)
for implementation details.

`imcp-server` treats client `stdin` closure as a normal shutdown, but treats
local network disconnects as transient. If the app-side TCP connection is reset
or cancelled while the MCP host is still alive, the CLI rediscovers iMCP over
Bonjour and reconnects instead of exiting immediately.

For this project, we created what became
[the official Swift SDK][swift-sdk]
for Model Context Protocol servers and clients.
The app uses this package to handle proxied requests from MCP clients.

### iMessage Database Access

Apple doesn't provide public APIs for accessing your messages.
However, the Messages app on macOS stores data in a SQLite database located at
`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`.

iMCP runs in [App Sandbox][app-sandbox],
which limits its access to user data and system resources.
When you go to enable the Messages service,
you'll be prompted to open the `chat.db` file through the standard file picker.
When you do, macOS adds that file to the app's sandbox.
[`NSOpenPanel`][nsopenpanel] is magic like that.

But opening the iMessage database is just half the battle.
Over the past few years,
Apple has moved away from storing messages in plain text
and instead toward a proprietary `typedstream` format.

For this project, we created [Madrid][madrid]:
a Swift package for reading your iMessage database.
It includes a Swift implementation for decoding Apple's `typedstream` format,
adapted from Christopher Sardegna's [imessage-exporter] project
and [blog post about reverse-engineering `typedstream`][typedstream-blog-post].

### JSON-LD for Tool Results

The tools provided by iMCP return results as
[JSON-LD][json-ld] documents.
For example,
the `fetchContacts` tool uses the [Contacts framework][contacts-framework],
which represents people and organizations with the [`CNContact`][cncontact] type.
Here's how an object of that type is encoded as JSON-LD:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Mattt",
  "url": "https://mat.tt"
}
```

[Schema.org][schema.org] provides standard vocabularies for
people, postal addresses, events, and many other objects we want to represent.
And JSON-LD is a convenient encoding format for
humans, AI, and conventional software alike.

For this project, we created [Ontology][ontology]:
a Swift package for working with structured data.
It includes convenience initializers for types from Apple frameworks,
such as those returned by iMCP tools.

## Debugging

### Using the MCP Inspector

To debug interactions between iMCP and clients,
you can use the [inspector tool](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
(requires Node.js):

1. Click <img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" /> > "Copy server command to clipboard"
2. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```console
   # Download and run inspector package on imcp-server
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector [paste-copied-command]

   # Open inspector web app running locally
   open http://127.0.0.1:6274
   ```

Inspector lets you see all requests and responses between the client and the iMCP server,
which is helpful for understanding how the protocol works.

### LaunchAgent logs

If you installed the keepalive LaunchAgent and iMCP is not starting as expected,
check the launchd logs:

```console
tail -n 100 /tmp/imcp-launchd.out.log
tail -n 100 /tmp/imcp-launchd.err.log
```

You can also restart the LaunchAgent manually:

```console
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$UID/com.rodaddy.iMCP.keepalive"
```

### Using Companion

<img align="right" width="284" src="/Assets/companion-screenshot-add-server.png" />

[Companion][companion] is a utility for testing and debugging your MCP servers
(requires macOS 15 or later).
It gives you an easy way to browse and interact with
a server's prompts, resources, and tools.
Here's how to connect it to iMCP:

1. Click <img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" /> > "Copy server command to clipboard"
2. [Download][companion-download] and open the Companion app
3. Click the <kbd>+</kbd> button in the toolbar to add an MCP server
4. Fill out the form:
   - Enter "iMCP" as the name
   - Select "STDIO" as the transport
   - Paste the copied iMCP server command
   - Click "Add Server"
